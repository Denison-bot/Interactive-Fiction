You find yourself at the doorway of a dilapidated church, crucifix in your left hand, a wooden stake in the right. #Your prey was sighted last at this church four hours prior when it attacked an ongoing funeral. #None made it out alive. ##Except for you...;enter church;pray for strength;1;2; 
You walk through the front doors of the church and you're met with an alarming sense of dread. #Pews are overturned, the alter is on the other side of the room, and a statue of Jesus has been toppled. ##To your left is a stairway leading to the priests quarters... ##Your quarters.;go to the statue of Jesus;go upstairs;3;6;
You kneel with your head bowed, and recite ##"Touch me, O Lord, and fill me with your light and your hope. #Dear God, please give me strength when I am weak, #love when I feel forsaken, #courage when I am afraid, #wisdom when I feel foolish, #comfort when I am alone, #hope when I feel rejected, #and peace when I am in turmoil. ##Amen."##At that moment you hear a screech above you, from a broken window on the second floor ##Certainly not from a human;enter the church;turn around and leave;1;13; 
You approach the overturned statue. #His head fell off at the neck when it hit the marble floor. ##Behind you theres a bang, and you feel a presence closing the distance behind you.;turn and attack with your stake;turn and defend yourself with your crucifix;4;5;
Your poorly aimed thrust is batted away with ease, and you feel fangs sink into your skin just above the collarbone. ##You die before seeing what the hellspawn even looked like;restart;quit;0;14;
As if guided by the lord himself, the hand holding his iconography lurches behind you, and your body follows through. ##A shriek pierces your ears as your foe recoils and sheilds it's eyes.##The beast before you barely resembles the human they used to be... ##The Vampire's pale, blotched skin showcases the crooked joints and broken bones under it's surface #like the thin veil of the widow he had devoured only hours earlier.;recite prayer;attack with stake;9;10;
You start up the the stairs that used to make you feel at home. But now you barely recognize it. ##As you approach your quarter's door, your sense of dread peaks.;turn back;enter your quarters;7;8";
Your sense of dread overcomes you, and you start back down the stairs. ##Halfway down, you hear your own door open. #Suddenly, you hear whatever did open it break into a sprint down the stairs behind you. ##You pick up your pace. ##By the time you reach the bottom, you sense your assailant directly behind you.;turn and attack with your stake;turn and defend yourself with your crucifix;4;5;
Inside your quarters you find the remains of the days funeral. ##Nearly two dozen- half devoured, half drained, and half dead funeral goers have been lazily piled on the floor of your home. ##Your holy place of rest has become a grotesque treasure trove of flesh. ##Before your body can react to what you just witnessed, two beastly hands grab you from above, claws sinking into your throat and cheek, #lifting you off your feet and tearing your neck. ##Your only shot at saving countless lives ends here.;restart;quit;0;14;
"In the Name of Jesus Christ, \nour God and Lord, #strengthened by the intercession of the Immaculate Virgin Mary, #Mother of God," ##The beast recoils further, shreiking like a banshee.;continue praying;attack with stake;11;10;
You make an attempt to thrust at the beast, but as soon as you lower your crucifix the monster lunges in the blink of an eye- ##Crushing your chest immedietly.;restart;quit;0;14;
"We drive you from us, whoever you may be, #unclean spirits, #all satanic powers, #all infernal invaders, #all wicked legions, assemblies and sects." ##The vampire falls on its back, writhing in pain, and lashing in every direction. #It's skin seems to smolder, and it's eyes wildly roll around in its head.;continue praying;attack with stake;15;12;
You see your window to slay the entity, and press your advantage. #In the blink of an eye you manage to close the gap between yourself and your foe. ##You plunge your wooden stake into the chest of the beast, it's brittle rib cage collapsing in and piercing its lungs ##This time there is no scream to fill the silent void in your old home. ##You drop to your knees, shaking. ##You've done it;replay;quit;0;14";
You decide a life of religion wasn't worth it anyways and abandon your community. #Only a month later you're found dead in the woods because you're a rube with no foraging skills and managed to poision yourself with toxic mushrooms.;restart;quit;0;14;

"Stoop beneath the all-powerful Hand of God. #Tremble and flee when we invoke the Holy and terrible Name of Jesus, #this Name which causes hell to tremble, #this Name to which the Virtues, Powers and Dominations of heaven are humbly submissive, #this Name which the Cherubim and Seraphim praise unceasingly repeating: #Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord, the God of Hosts." ##The creature lets out one final cry of pain, straining it's body against an invisible holy power. #Suddenly it all stops. The crying, the panic, and the straining all cease in unison. ##Before you lies a naked, middle aged man. His body no longer distorted by his unholy affliction. ##You lean down to inspect the unconscious body, starting of course with his mouth. #Inside you find a set of perfectly human teeth. ##You saved at least one soul tonight.;replay;quit;0;14;
